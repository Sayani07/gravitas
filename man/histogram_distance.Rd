\title{Plotting histogram of distances between probability distributions}
\usage{
histogram_distance(
  .data = NULL,
  gran1 = NULL,
  gran2 = NULL,
  response = NULL,
  prob = seq(0.01, 0.99, 0.01),
  hierarchy_tbl = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{a tsibble.}

\item{gran1}{the granularity which is to be placed across facets. Can be column names if required granularity already exists in the tsibble. For example, a column with public holidays which needs to be treated as granularity, can be included here.}

\item{gran2}{the granularity to be placed across x-axis. Can be column names if required granularity already exists in the tsibble.}

\item{response}{response vari'able.}

\item{prob}{numeric vector of probabilities with values in [0,1].}

\item{hierarchy_tbl}{A hierarchy table specifying the hierarchy of units}
}
\description{
Plot probability distribution of univariate series across bivariate temporal granularities.
